inputs.py is a module that holds classes and their instances that are
responsible for transferring input data (like from sensors) to Blender space.

E.g. 'pivision' and 'nmpt_saliency' inputs are instances of RegionOfInterest, which
inherits from ObjectInBlender and control small cubes in Blender space
according to received ROS messages.

Input instances can be reached by either:
inputs.store.<instancename> or inputs.get_instance(<instancename>),
where <instancename> can be pivision, nmpt_saliency, etc.

See config/inputs.yaml for available input instances.

All input classes should inherit from inputs.bases.InputBase
