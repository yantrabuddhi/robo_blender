--Description--
Package 'modes' holds modules that control the main flow of robot behavior.
When a module is set active, its step() method is called at the fps set in
config/config.yaml.

A different module can be enabled at any time by calling
the modes.enable() method or sending a ROS message to cmd_blendermode with a
different module name. Currently only one module can be active at a time.

Note: Not sure if enabling the modes repeatedly will cause the memory to leak.
Keep an eye out.

--Creating new modes--
Just create a new python file inside the 'modes' directory. It will be found
automatically.

The new mode file (module) needs to have a class with the same name as the
module with a step(self, dt) method.

Look at the example mode SmartTrack2.py for a reference.
